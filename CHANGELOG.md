# Changelog

All notable changes. Versions are git tags; the running version is shown in the
console footer, `/health` and `/api/status`.

## v1.0.0 — Multi-influencer core + Generation Engine

**Platform**
- One deployment now runs many influencers. Every table that holds
  influencer data carries `influencer_id`; every job carries its owner and runs
  inside that influencer's context (persona, knowledge, controls, Instagram
  account, budgets). Cross-influencer access is a hard error, not a warning.
- Webhooks are routed per entry to the influencer that owns the Instagram
  account; unknown accounts are dropped.
- Controls are layered: platform values (influencer 0) under per-influencer
  values. New platform-wide daily/monthly budget ceilings.
- Persona and knowledge live in the database (versioned); `config/persona.yaml`
  only seeds influencer #1 on upgrade (`PERSONA_SYNC_FROM_FILE=true` keeps
  syncing it).
- **Souls**: each influencer has a versioned identity pack (approved face
  references + provider bindings such as a Higgsfield Soul ID). Zuri was
  migrated to `soul_zuri_v1`.
- In-app **settings** (`app_settings`, AES-256-GCM): provider keys can be set
  in the console and override environment variables. LLM, storage, Telegram,
  webhook and OAuth settings are re-read without a restart.

**Generation Engine** (brief v2)
- Provider-agnostic contract, model/provider registry (DB is the source of
  truth; the code catalog seeds it), deterministic router (fixed,
  preferred+fallback, best quality, best value, fastest, capability-first,
  auto), idempotent requests, fallback on transient/provider classes only
  (never on content policy or budget), rolling health with automatic
  quarantine, durable influencer-scoped asset storage, per-attempt audit.
- Adapters: kie.ai, Higgsfield (incl. Soul ID training), fal.ai, Replicate,
  Runway, Luma (Agents API), Topview, plus an offline mock. 25 catalog models
  across image, reference/identity, edit, upscale and image/text-to-video.

**Calendar (backend)**: operator events (world or per influencer) feed the
content director and conversation context; ended events with an outcome are
recapped hourly into world memory.

**Fixes found during the upgrade**
- Webhook signature checks are awaited (they became async).
- Memory-extraction jobs carry their influencer.

Tests: 201 (router, engine fallback/idempotency/quarantine/budget, adapter
contracts for all providers, two-influencer isolation, settings, bootstrap,
calendar recaps).
